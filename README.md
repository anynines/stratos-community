# Stratos UI pre-packager


This feature helps in pre-building the
[Stratos](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/stratos) web application
so that it can be deployed faster in Cloud Foundry, or be run offline.

You can find pre-built versions of Stratos UI in the
[releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/stratos/releases)
of this repository.

To run those `.zip` packages inside Cloud Foundry, unzip it, write a manifest,
and `cf push` it.

You are not required to have
[stratos-buildpack](https://github.com/SUSE/stratos-buildpack), you can use
binary buildpack.

Here is an example app manifest that worked for us:
```yaml
applications:
  - name: console
    memory: 128M
    disk_quota: 192M
    host: console
    timeout: 180
    buildpack: binary_buildpack
    health-check-type: port
```

For best results rather than pushing manually instead use within the (Genesis CF Kit)[https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-genesis-kit] like so:
```
genesis <env-name> do stratos sgs
```
Note: `sgs` creates security groups the first time, upgrades do not use `sgs`.

## Packaging

Golang is required, and version 1.12 is recommended as this is the version used by the Stratos build system.

When you want to build the `4.1.2` tag in
[Stratos UI releases](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/stratos/releases),
run this command:

```bash
./bin/package
```
OR to package a specific tag
```bash
TAG="4.1.2" ./bin/package 
```

### NOTE
The original code for this feature can be found in the
[Orange Cloud foundry Github Repository](https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/stratos-ui-cf-packager/). 
Many thanks to Benjamin & Arthur, we appreciate you both!
